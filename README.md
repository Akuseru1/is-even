# The definitive isEven() Collection!
Let's see how many implementations we can get of isEven.

The function should take in a number value and output a truthy value if the input is even.

# How to Contribute
If you would like to contribute, please fork the repo and make a Pull Request.
Each language will have its own markdown file containing each entry. If you plan to add an entry, use this format:

## Entry name
Contributed by: {{ your name }} (optional: as link to github profile)

{{ description of your implementation if you deem it necessary }}

```{language
Your awesome code

```

# Adding a new language
I have added some initial languages as examples, but you can feel free to add any language you would like. If you would like to add a new language file that does not exist, make a new file {{language name}}.md and put the top level header as the name of the language.
